# teapo v0.5a

Self-editing filesystem embedded in a single HTML file.

The idea, all of the painstaking implementation and the vision by [Oleg Mihailik](mihailik@gmail.com).
See the credits section for the used libraries and respective licences. 

### Outstanding tasks:
 * Styles and colours (planning for pale seaside 'Whitstable' blue).
 * Scrollbar to simply show coloured rendering of the CodeMirror document.
 * TypeScript extra features: current signature/symbol in the status, tooltips.
 * More local storage adapters.
 * Delete folder.
 * Rename file/folder.
 * Upload to GitHub, GDrive, Dropbox etc.
 * Stronger browser support (the target is ALL).
 * FS integration in Chrome app, node-webkit, HTMLA-ie7.
 * node emulation over teapo-Drive.
 * Toast popup/fadeout messages for key events: opening, building, import-export completion.
 * Sub-domains for doc handlers (separate contexts in TS/JS for selected subdirectories)
 * Demos in the repository: itself, TypeScript whole, PE.js, dummy sample

The next big version cut is planned for Christmas.
